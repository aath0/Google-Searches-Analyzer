# Analysis of google search history data

### With this notebook you can analyze your google search history data. 

For example, you can compute your top searches per month, or obtain graphs of the top co-occurring terms within your searches. 

You can request your search history data from google, but beware! The data file that you'll get will contain your search terms, along with the date and time when you did these searches, and the websites that you visited after each search.

It only takes a few clicks!
